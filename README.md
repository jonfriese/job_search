This is a job board aggregator. Currently it searches:

-StackOverflow Careers

-Github Jobs

-Ruby Now

-Authentic Jobs

-Reddit /r/forhire

-We Work Remotely

-Craigslist*

*Craigslist blocks requests from EC2 so Craigslist results will not be yielded from the Heroku app, as of right now. EDIT: It just started working, so we'll see. It might work and it might not.
